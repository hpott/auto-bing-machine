# Auto Bing Machine
**DISCLOSURE: THIS IS DESIGNED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPORSES ONLY. I'M NOT REPOSONSIBLE IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE**
## Background
I created the auto bing machine because I don't like Microsoft. A few of my friends asked me about automating Microsoft Rewards so I made this script one night.
## Requirements
- Firefox (I'll add chrome support eventually)
- Python 3
- Selenium
- A UNIX based operating system (Linux, Mac, BSD, etc)

## Installation
Step 1: Install requirements

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Step 2: Install GeckoDriver

Go to https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases then download for your operating system and copy it to /usr/bin or somewhere on your PATH

Step 3: Run the script

```bash
python3 ./main.py
```
